# OneRuleToRuleThemAll

This is a custom hashcat rule, the original supporting blog post of which I wrote when I worked at https://www.notsosecure.com 

Several default and non-default hashcat rules were individually tested over a set of 4.3 million unique MD5 hashes from a data breach.
Hashcat debugging provided statistical analysis of the best performing and most efficient rules in each test.
The best performing 25% of rules from each tested ruleset were extracted and concatenated into a new custom rule.

OneRuleToRuleThemAll cracked 68.36% of the 4.3 million hashes; an increase of 2.72% (117,626 hashes) over second place which was the hashcat supplied dive rule.
